The "WB CSV Importer" allows importing CSV files with SportTracks. The importer is intended for migrating running journals or training data from other applications into SportTracks.

= CSV File Format =

The following data fields are supported:
Date, time, datetime, timestamp, rowdate, entrydate, distance, totaldistance, duration, tottime, elapsed time, elevation, latitude, longitude, hrm, heartrate, heartaverage, pulse, puls, climbed, cadence, rpm, power, watt, averagewatts, calories, totalcalories, joule, intensity, category, activity, subcategory, location, name, description, comment, comments, details, equipment, weight, bodyweight, bmi, bodyfat, restingheartrate, resthr, maxheartrate, heartmax, systolic, diastolic, sleep, diary, mood



The csv file should look like this:

date;time;distance;duration;hrm;category;location;name;comment;weight;bmi;bodyfat;restingheartrate;maxheartrate;systolic;diastolic
06/24/2008;18:00;10;0:50:42;140;Running:Forrest;Seattle;Main;Interval workout;59.4;21.8;16.9;44;185;120;80
06/25/2008;18:45;8.5;0:40:38;150;Running:Forrest;Seattle;Main;;59.1;21.7;16.6;46;185;125;82
06/26/2008;18:30;25;2:15:30;130;Running:Forrest;Seattle;;Long run;59.6;21.9;17.0;44;185;118;78



The first line defines the contained fields. The fields can have any order.
The line lists the field names separated by a separator character.
Supported separators are: Tab ; ,
The same separator must be used for all lines.


Units can be given behind the values:
date;time;distance
06/24/2008;18:00;10 k
06/25/2008;18:45;8.5 k


Units can be defined in the header as well:
date;time;distance (km)
06/24/2008;18:00;10
06/25/2008;18:45;8.5


Each following line defines an activity or a trackpoint.

When no date is given, multiple lines refer to the same date, or GPS coordinates are found,
the file is handled as one acitivity with multiple trackpoints.
Otherwise each line is handled as one activity.


The number of entries for all data lines must match the number of defined fields in the first line.
When a value contains a separator, the value has to be quoted with double quotation marks,
like "running; long distance".
When a value is not known but the corresponding field was defined in the first line,
the value can be omitted but the following separator must be given nevertheless (see the sample above).




= Supported fields =

date, entrydate: date of workout, formatted as configured in windows for the current locale.
So 04/24/2008 would be typical for the US, the same date would be 24.04.2008 for Germany.
The plugin tries parsing the date by using the current windows configuration.
If this does not work, it tries the US and German date format as a fallback.

2008-06-07T07:30:42 would be typical for the US.

= Installation =

*First time installation of the WB CSV Importer Plugin:*
- Click on the download link
- Download the st3plugin file to your harddisk
- Close SportTracks.
- Doubleclick the st3plugin file, SportTracks will install the plugin
- Launch SportTracks.
- The "WB CSV Importer" will be listed as one of the installed plugins (Settings -> Plugins).

*Updating the WB CSV Importer Plugin:*
- Launch SportTracks.
- Click on "Other Tasks\Settings" in the left pane, then click on "Plugins"
- SportTracks will check for updates and show that an update is available
- Select the "WB CSV Importer" plugin
- Then click on "Install Update" and follow the instructions
- If SportTracks reports that the plugin has to be uninstalled manually, just proceed with "First time installation". The clean installation will work and the "WB CSV Importer" plugin will remove the old file on first start.



= Usage =
From SportTracks click on import and choose the CSV file to be imported.

*Excel Hints*
Important: The plugin does not support line breaks within one data line.
So when you edit your data in Excel and there are e.g. comment fields with line breaks,
Excel would export a csv file containing additional line breaks.
Here is a trick for removing all obsolete line breaks with an Excel macro:
Record an dummy simple Excel macro. Then edit the macro and replace the sub content with something like this:
{{{
Sub Makro1()
Range("a1:ag1592").Replace _
What:=Chr(13), Replacement:=", "
Range("a1:ag1592").Replace _
What:=Chr(10), Replacement:=""
End Sub
}}}
This macro would replace all line breaks within the range a1:ag1592 with a comma.
Close the macro editor and run the macro.


*iBike Hints*

A solitude import of an iBike csv file works. You don't need to delete the header lines in advance.
The time delta per data line is detected from the header lines.

If you want to import both data from Garmin Edge and iBike, please import at first the
GPS data. In a second step import the iBike CSV file. 

The plugin gets the duration of the iBike file and the GPS track. The time difference is the pause time
that needs to be inserted into the iBike file (the iBike file does not contain information about pauses).
Then the plugin finds the threshold speed from the GPS track so that the resulting pause time matches
the "time to be inserted". For the pause intervals (where speed is below threshold in the GPS data),
the plugin inserts 0 for power and cadence. In that way the data profile of the iBike file is not changed.
