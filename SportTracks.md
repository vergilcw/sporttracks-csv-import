# SportTracks #

SportTracks uses data from GPS-enabled devices to automatically track the distance, time, and pace of an athlete's workouts. Users can take a high level view and track their progress over time, or dive into the details of a specific workout to analyze pace, elevation, or heart-rate performance. Activities can be organized into categories, summarized by location, and more. With the SportTracks Plugin API, developers and corporate partners can extend analysis features, modify data import/export functions, or add support for new devices.
